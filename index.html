                <br>
                <p>
                    My name is Kate Aiken and I am passionate about robotics, sailing and sports. I have kept busy with
                    volunteering and extracurricular activities as they remain true to who I am as an engineering
                    student, athlete and coach/mentor. This unique combination of interests gives me a great perspective
                    for helping young students and athletes figure out who they are. This is especially important for
                    girls, as helping them find their way into STEM and sports allows them to find their footing in a
                    world that presents unique challenges to everyone. The journey to being able to participate in all
                    of the activities I do now was not an easy one but I finally feel I have found where I am meant to
                    be and what I am meant to do.
