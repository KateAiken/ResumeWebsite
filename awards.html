                <h2>Schulich Leader Nominee</h2><br>
                <p>I was honored to be nominated for the Schulich Leader Scholarship in 2024 in recognition of my
                    academic achievements, leadership qualities, and dedication to STEM. I have had the opportunity to
                    support young girls in STEM by mentoring them, helping to boost their confidence and engagement in
                    technical fields. Additionally, I have led a MATE Robotics team, focusing on collaborative
                    problem-solving and preparing for competitions. By balancing my academic responsibilities with
                    mentorship and team leadership, I have aimed to demonstrate perseverance, integrity, and a sincere
                    commitment to making a positive impact through STEM leadership. This nomination reflects not only my
                    own efforts, but also the incredible teams and young learners I’ve had the privilege to support.

                <h2>C.D. Howe Engineering Scholarship Nominee</h2><br>
                <p>The C.D. Howe Scholarship is a scholarship for students studying Engineering in their undergraduate
                    degree. To be considered you need to be nominated by your university and I was one of two
                    nominations from Queens University in 2025. Students are considered for this scholarship who have
                    significant involvement in the STEM world but also a balanced life with other co-curriculars and
                    academic performance. My nomination reflected my sustained engagement in STEM outreach, robotics
                    leadership, and engineering design, as well as my dedication to maintaining excellence across
                    academics, extracurriculars, and mentorship.

                <h2>Female Trailblazer</h2><br>
                <p>At the MATE ROV competition in my grade 12 year I was presented with the Female Trailblazer award.
                    The MATE ROV competition includes specific recognition for women in the field, often presenting a
                    "Female Trailblazer" award to recognize outstanding young women in the Ranger class. The competition
                    itself aims to foster the next generation of engineers and scientists, including women, by focusing
                    on real-world ocean technologies. It was a surprise and an honour to receive this award recognizing
                    not only my technical contributions, but also my commitment to leading by example and supporting
                    other young women in STEM.

                <h2>2nd Place in Queens Engineering Competition Programming Catagory</h2><br>
                <p>My team and I won 2nd place in the programming section of the 2024 Queens Engineering Competition
                    (QEC) in 2024. As first years we signed up to compete for the experience and networking with no
                    expectation of placing among the older, more experienced. We were tasked with designing a website to
                    address a health concern and we selected mental health. We designed a website to help users track
                    their mental health and a machine learning algorithm to read user responses and generate
                    personalized suggestions for the users. Our final prototype was a simple but functional website and
                    basic machine learning code that were designed to be simple and low stress to use. Despite being
                    early in our engineering studies, we delivered a thoughtful, technically sound solution that
                    resonated with judges and demonstrated our ability to combine programming, design thinking, and
                    empathy‑driven problem solving.

                <h2>AP Information and Computer Sciences Achievment Award</h2><br>
                <p>The AP Computer Science awards is given to the student in the highest standing in the course at the
                    end of the year. Computer science was always my favourite course and working on coding projects
                    never felt like school work. In computer science classes in high school I learned both python and
                    java and completed many fun, interesting and difficult projects such as hangman and 2048. These
                    projects strengthened my problem‑solving skills, deepened my understanding of programming
                    fundamentals, and confirmed my passion for software development.

                <h2>NCWIT Ontario Affiliate High School Award Winner</h2><br>
                <p>In Grade 12 I was given an award from the NCWIT for Aspirations in Computing (AiC) High School
                    students in the AiC Community for their computing-related achievements and interests, and encouraged
                    them to pursue their passions. Award recipients are selected based on their aptitude and aspirations
                    in technology and computing, as demonstrated by their computing experience, computing-related
                    activities, leadership experience, persistence, and future plans. It's an honour to be a part of
                    this community and it was an incredible experience to listen to the women in the community to share
                    their stories and meet students with the same passions and interests at the ceremony. Becoming part
                    of this community reinforced my commitment to pursuing computing and supporting other young women in
                    STEM. </p>

                <h2>Active Citizen Award</h2><br>
                <p>The active citizen award is an award given to high school students who completed over 60
                    volunteer hours in one year. This is to recognize students who went above and beyond in their
                    community. Through high school I volunteered at many places including my sailing club, a dog
                    shelter, a learn how to skate program and my school. I found by diversifying where I volunteered I
                    was able to help a lot more people and gain more experiences. Most of my volunteer hours that went
                    towards this award were spent organizing and redesigning my school's tech lab. This was a massive
                    undertaking for one person and I spent mornings before school and spares working on it: not only
                    cleaning up and redesigning the space but also compiling a list of upgrades that were eventually
                    funded and implemented making it a nicer more usable space for the future students. All of my
                    volunteer experiences were rewarding, but the tech‑lab project was especially meaningful. Knowing
                    that the space will support and inspire girls in STEM for years to come made the work deeply
                    worthwhile. </p>
