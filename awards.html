                <h2>Schulich Leader Nominee</h2><br>
                <p>
                    I was honored to be nominated for the Schulich Leader Scholarship in 2024 in recognition of my
                    academic achievements, leadership qualities, and dedication to STEM. I have had the opportunity
                    to support young girls in STEM by mentoring them, helping to boost their confidence and
                    engagement in technical fields. Additionally, I have led a MATE Robotics team, focusing on
                    collaborative problem-solving and preparing for competitions. By balancing my academic
                    responsibilities with mentorship and team leadership, I have aimed to demonstrate perseverance,
                    integrity, and a sincere commitment to making a positive impact through STEM leadership.

                <p>
                    The C.D. Howe Scholarship is a scholarship for students studying Engineering in their
                    undergraduate degree. To be considered you need to be nominated by your university and I was one
                    of two nominations from Queens University in 2025. Students are considered for this scholarship
                    who have significant involvement in the STEM world but also a balanced life with other
                    co-curriculars and academic performance.

                <p>
                    At the MATE ROV competition in my grade 12 year I was presented with the Female Trailblazer
                    award. The MATE ROV competition includes specific recognition for women in the field, often
                    presenting a "Female Trailblazer" award to recognize outstanding young women in the Ranger
                    class. The competition itself aims to foster the next generation of engineers and scientists,
                    including women, by focusing on real-world ocean technologies. It was a surprise and an honour
                    to receive this award recognizing all the time, effort and hard work I put into Waldo 16 before
                    and at the competition.

                <h2>2nd Place in Queens Engineering Competition Programming Catagory</h2><br>
                <p>My team and I won 2nd place in the programming section of the 2024 Queens Engineering Competition
                    (QEC) in 2024. As first years we signed up to compete for the experience and networking with no
                    expectation of placing among the older, more experienced. We were tasked with designing a
                    website to address a health concern and we selected mental health. We designed a website to help
                    users track their mental health and a machine learning algorithm to read user responses and
                    generate personalized suggestions for the users. Our final prototype was a simple but functional
                    website and basic machine learning code that were designed to be simple and low stress to use.

                    the end of the year. Computer science was always my favourite course and working on coding
                    projects never felt like school work. In computer science classes in high school I learned both
                    python and java and completed many fun, interesting and difficult projects such as hangman and

                <h2>NCWIT Ontario Affiliate High School Award Winner</h2><br>
                <p>In Grade 12 I was given an award from the NCWIT for Aspirations in Computing (AiC) High School
                    students in the AiC Community for their computing-related achievements and interests, and
                    encouraged them to pursue their passions. Award recipients are selected based on their aptitude
                    and aspirations in technology and computing, as demonstrated by their computing experience,
                    computing-related activities, leadership experience, persistence, and future plans. It's an
                    honour to be a part of this community and it was an incredible experience to listen to the women
                    in the community to share their stories and meet students with the same passions and interests
                    at the ceremony. </p>

                <h2>Active Citizenship Award</h2><br>
                <p>The active citizenship award is an award given to high school students who completed over 60
                    volunteer hours in one year. This is to recognize students who went above and beyond in their
                    community. Through high school I volunteered at many places including my sailing club, a dog
                    shelter, a learn how to skate program and my school. I found by diversifying where I volunteered
                    I was able to help a lot more people and gain more experiences. Most of my volunteer hours that
                    went towards this award were spent organizing and redesigning my school's tech lab. This was a
                    massive undertaking for one person and I spent mornings before school and spares working on it
                    not only cleaning up and redesigning the space but also compiling a list of upgrades that were
                    eventually funded and implemented making it a nicer more usable space for the future students.
                    All of my volunteer experiences have been rewarding but working in the lab especially because it
                    will have an effect on the girls and their STEM education for many years to come. </p>
