            <h2>Nautical Disaster - Autonomous Uncrewed Surface Vehicle</h2>
            <p>
                The Nautical Disaster is the first boat created by the aQuatonomous design team at Queens University. The team designs and builds an autonomous boat to participate in a global competition. I joined the electrical subteam where I made a name for myself helping with the layout and power distribution. I found myself drawn to the telemetry (autopilot) system which includes gps, communication, motor control and the autopilot itself. I worked on the hardware and software components of the telemetry and eventually was selected as one of three general members (and only first year member) to attend the competition. At the competition we faced a multitude of issues from the telemetry system failing to the autonomy unable to connect. Our solutions required several redesigns of the electrical box, under my direction. Eventually, with the telemetry and electrical systems functioning, we qualified for four out of five semifinals. It was a very successful competition for a first year team, placing 7th with our best run.

            <h2>Fluidized Air Bed</h2>
            <p>
                As my final lab in Grade 12 Physics my partner and I were tasked with showing the “Magic of Physics” in a presentation to younger students in my school. We decided to build a fluidized airbed which is a box that pumps air into sand making the sand act like liquid. This was a difficult project as it was very precise to build and also needed very fine sand to work properly. It ended up working quite well as you can see in the video where when the weight is visible the air is turned off and the sand is acting normally. Once the air turns on the tennis ball floats up and the weight sinks showing the massive change in the sands density.

            <h2>Waldo 16</h2>
            <p>
                Waldo 16 was built by my school's Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) team for our second year attending the competition in Newfoundland. Waldo 16 was designed with four motors to control its movement on the XY-axis allowing it to move forwards/backwards, turn left/right and strafe left/right and two motors to move it up and down on the Z-axis. It was also equipped with two cameras and two claws, one vertical and one horizontal to give the driver a visual on the front and back of the robot making it more versatile. The year Waldo 16 was built I was acting as both the Head Engineer and Lead Software and Electrical Engineer. As the head engineer I worked on making sure the ROV worked and all parts functioned together for example making sure the motors were attached in the correct place so the strafing code worked correctly. As Lead Software and Electrical engineer I designed and assembled the electrical system and wrote the ROVs code while also mentoring a younger student to take on my role when I graduated.

            <p>
                I acted as Captain of my high school's first VEX team where I built the field, taught other students about it and took the team to our first competition in Toronto. It was a difficult season because the team was brand new and we had limited time to work on the robot due to conflicting lab times. We successfully participated in both the autonomous and manual drive parts of the competition and learned a lot in the experience.
