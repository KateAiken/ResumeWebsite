                <h2>Nautical Disaster - Autonomous Uncrewed Surface Vehicle</h2><br>
                <p>The Nautical Disaster is the first boat created by the aQuatonomous design team at Queens University.
                    The team designs and builds an autonomous boat to participate in a global competition. I joined the
                    electrical subteam where I made a name for myself helping with the layout and power distribution. I
                    found myself drawn to the telemetry (autopilot) system which includes gps, communication, motor
                    control and the autopilot itself. I worked on the hardware and software components of the telemetry
                    and eventually was selected as one of three general members (and only first year member) to attend
                    the competition. At the competition we faced a multitude of issues from the telemetry system failing
                    to the autonomy unable to connect. Under my direction, we redesigned and rebuilt the electrical box
                    multiple times to resolve these issues.
                    Eventually, with the telemetry and electrical systems functioning, we qualified for four out of five
                    semifinals. It was a very successful competition for a first year team, placing 7th with our best
                    run.

                <h2>Website</h2><br>
                <p>I built my resume website not only as a way to display my projects and experience but also to
                    demonstrate my coding ability. This project was coded in HTML, CSS and Javascript without using any
                    web templates or website development tools. This was a large project for me to undertake. I decided
                    to use AI to help me get started and generated a simple code to make a website that had a few pages
                    and basic functionality. By using the base it gave me, I created my own website experimenting with
                    different page layouts and website designs. Working on such a large scale project in HTML and CSS
                    gave me a lot of practice troubleshooting in those languages such as when linking doesn't work as
                    expected and gave me practice using tools such as google development tools to find the problem. The
                    outcome demonstrates what I have added to my knowledge base as well as illustrating my versatility
                    and curiosity. Another benefit of this website development is that as I complete more projects and
                    gain more experience, I can add to the contents as well as build upon the functionality.

                <h2>Morse Code Sender & Receiver</h2><br>
                <p>As my final project for MREN174, Data Structures, I built a morse coder translator that can send and
                    receive messages with other units. The hardware consists of an arduino with an LCD screen connected
                    to a transmotter/receiver, LED and buzzer. The code used several different data structures including
                    a binary search tree to assign combinations of dots and dashes to a letter, a queue to manage
                    incoming and outcoming messages and a stack to manage the sorting of words or sentences into
                    letters. The system can take an input of either letters or dots/dashes and outputs both to the other
                    units once sent. This was the largest coding project I had taken on to date so in this process I
                    learned a lot about correctly integrating into GitHub, using debugger tools in VS code and
                    integrating C files to the arduino. I was so proud to submit a working code and prototype after many
                    weeks of hard work. This project was designed to be implemented as a backup safety tool for people
                    who may be unable to get to people or use walkie talkies or phones for help like hikers or residents
                    of small towns.

                <h2>Louie - Mini Bot</h2><br>
                <p>I got the opportunity to work on the mini bot as part of my first year project course MREN103,
                    Mechatronics Design I. We were tasked to design a line‑following algorithm designed to navigate a
                    course, collect wire connectors, and deposit them into a bucket on the opposite side of the board.
                    This project involved a lot of tuning and the use of several sensors including sharp sensors and
                    reflective sensors. The goal of the project left room for creative solutions when faced with
                    challenges. One of the biggest challenges we faced was turning a full circle once we were near the
                    wall so we moved the sharp sensor to the bucket side of the robot and designed a backwards line
                    following code. This allowed us to use the reflective sensor to recognize when we had turned 90
                    degrees and reverse, pushing the basket straight into the wire connectors.

                <h2>Autimated Pre-Treatment Water System Prototype</h2><br>
                <p>My team and I built a pre-treatment water system prototype for APSC 101, our first year project
                    course. The prompt was to build a pre-treatment water system to make drinkable water for a small
                    town in Northern Canada. Some of the restrictions to our design were: space, cost and ability to get
                    materials to the final build location. We built the prototype that sent water through multiple
                    filtering steps and checked its cleanliness at the end with a turbidity sensor. As the software lead
                    on the project I wrote the code that ran the filter. The process worked in 4 phases using if
                    statements to determine the active phase and what the sensor associated with that phase was reading.
                    For example, at the beginning of the program, the execution does not start until the start button is
                    pressed after which the Phase 1 if statement is entered. This solution made the process modular but
                    also consistent and minimized the use of delays which would have prevented sensors from reading
                    while the delay occurred. We went above and beyond the expectations and included status LEDs to
                    indicate what step of the process we were at and several custom 3D printed pieces to elevate the
                    design.

                <p>Waldo 16 was built by my school's Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Remote Operated Vehicle
                    (ROV) team for our second year attending the competition in Newfoundland. Waldo 16 was designed with
                    four motors to control its movement on the XY-axis allowing it to move forwards/backwards, laterally
                    left/right, turn left/right and two motors to move it up and down on the Z-axis. It was also
                    equipped with two cameras and two claws: one vertical and one horizontal to give the driver a visual
                    on the front and back of the robot making it more versatile. The year Waldo 16 was built I was
                    acting as both the Head Engineer and Lead Software and Electrical Engineer. As the head engineer I
                    worked on making sure the ROV worked and all parts functioned together for example making sure the
                    motors were attached in the correct place so the strafing code worked correctly. As Lead Software
                    and Electrical engineer I designed and assembled the electrical system and wrote the ROV’s code
                    while also mentoring a younger student to take over my responsibilities after graduation, ensuring
                    continuity and knowledge transfer within the team.

                <h2>Fluidized Air Bed</h2><br>
                <p>As my final lab in Grade 12 Physics my partner and I were tasked with showing the “Magic of Physics”
                    in a presentation to younger students in my school. We decided to build a fluidized airbed which is
                    a box that pumps air into sand making the sand act like liquid. This was a difficult project as it
                    was very precise to build and also needed very fine sand to work properly. It ended up working quite
                    well as you can see in the video where when the hand weight is visible the air is turned off and the
                    sand is acting normally. Once the air was turned on, the sand transitioned into a fluid‑like state:
                    the tennis ball rose to the surface while the heavier weight sank, clearly illustrating the dramatic
                    change in density and particle behavior.

                <h2>Hangman Python Code</h2><br>
                <p>I wrote code for a Hangman game as a part of my Grade 11 Computer Science class. This was a python
                    based project taking advantage of ACSII style art to provide a visual of a hangman figure. The code
                    uses lists to contain words with multiple different themes that the user can select. It sets up the
                    game with empty spots with the number of letters and an empty hangman stand. As the user guesses
                    letters, the game uses loops to check if they are correct and sends the corresponding information to
                    the user. The game also records the number of guesses and indicates a failure if the user does not
                    guess the word after 6 tries. The user can input either a letter or a word as a guess making the
                    game very versatile and the game can handle upper and lower case letters. One of the interesting
                    features of this game is it is unbreakable, meaning you can't enter anything that will cause the
                    code to fail including letters, symbols etc. This feature uses the characters decimal code to make
                    sure it is in the range of lower or upper case characters.

                <p>I wrote code for the game 2048 as my final project in my Grade 11 Computer Science class. The game
                    2048 is a classic number game where you have a four by four grid and a two block is generated into
                    an empty spot in the grid after every move. The goal is to combine two of the same numbers together
                    which adds the numbers and get as high a number as possible or eventually the number “2048”. This
                    was a very difficult project to code as it was also my first time working on graphics with the
                    PyGame library. In grade 11, I had a fully working graphic interface for the game but the game only
                    progressed to combining to 16 because I had an inefficient structure for checking which blocks
                    existed on the grid. In grade 12 I attacked the project again but with more experience and in Java
                    and was able to use 2D arrays to recreate the game. I started working on translating that code into
                    python to work with the graphics and had the graphics partially working before the submission date.

                    the setup to 4 motors to control the forward/backward/turning and up/down movement. Once that was
                    working we extended the setup to send the signal down 48ft of cable to give the robot maximum
                    maneuverability underwater and integrated the claw into the controller. We had a successful
                    competition placing 3rd in the product demonstration and 2nd in the engineering presentation. The

                <p>In today's world, water usage is a huge concern. In remote or underdeveloped countries, access to
                    safe/clean water can be almost impossible to find. The question we had was: Is it possible to create
                    a compact and accessible system to reuse the water? In this project, we designed and built a sink to
                    filter out particles and bacteria in the water. With research, we created a formula to simulate
                    handwashing. Our testing criteria consisted of standard water tests to check the safety of the
                    water. By running the handwashing solution through the filter, we learned the filter could only
                    filter physical things out of the water, not chemicals. This finding highlighted both the potential
                    and the limitations of small‑scale filtration systems, and it provided valuable insight into the
                    additional treatment steps required for producing fully safe, reusable water.
