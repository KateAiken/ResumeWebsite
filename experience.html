                <h2>Systems Integration Director</h2><br>
                <p>When I started university I knew I would join a design team and I jumped at the opportunity
                    to join another water related one, aQuatonomous. I first joined as a general electrical
                    engineer and was assigned to work on the telemetry of the boat. I learned how to use
                    Ardupilot, a software program that works with a pixhawk which is a piece of hardware that
                    interprets commands from the brain of the boat and translates them to the motors using IMU
                    and GPS input. With the importance of my project I was invited to attend the competition
                    with the team. At the competition we made it to semi-finals which was a lot better than
                    expected as it was our first year competing. With the experience of the competition, several
                    of the executives recommended that I apply for a leadership position on the team to further
                    advance my expertise and help mentor others and further advance the buildout of the team. I
                    interviewed for and was awarded the position of Systems Integration Director, a new subteam
                    created from our first year experience and my suggestions for improving the integration of
                    the subsystems. This year has progressive quite well as my team and I have worked on
                    learning more about the software and using data logs from competition runs to check and
                    improve signal strength as well as prep for tuning once the boat hits the water. I am very
                    excited for what is to come at the competition this year especially with the massive strides
                    the team has made with all parts of the boat.</p>

                <h2>Optimist Race & Sailing Coach</h2><br>
                <p>
                    As an Opti Race Coach I had the opportunity to train racers through the spring and summer
                    season and travel across Ontario to compete in local and International regattas. My work this
                    summer included designing and implementing a spring and summer training program which catered to
                    all ranges of experience in sailing and racing. With the younger sailors I focused on
                    introducing them to racing while improving and evolving their sailing skills and taking them to
                    their first regattas to compete with sailors at the same level as them. With my older sailors I
                    worked
                    to elevated skills there resulting in numerous fleet wins and podium placings. I also worked on
                    engaging sailors as a team with fun competition and games on and off the water so they could
                    bond as a team. After camp hours I performed boat and sail maintenance including the set up
                    of 6 brand new boats, gel coating and other repairs.

                <p>
                    The MATE competition is an underwater remote operated vehicle (ROV) competition where we
                    designed and built a robot to complete a set of underwater tasks in a competition. In my first year
                    participating on the MATE team, my skills were evident and in demand and I was given the
                    role of Head Software and Electrical Engineer, where I was tasked with assembling the electrical
                    systems and code, essentially on my own. In my second year I kept the same role and also added the
                    title of the Head Engineer, where I was responsible for integrating all the subteams while
                    simultaneously mentoring a student to assume my roles after I graduated. Our team travelled
                    from Ontario to Newfoundland to compete. I am proud that we performed well in each competition,
                    placing second with our engineering presentation both years and third in the robot’s
                    performance competition in our first year. I received the Female Trailblazer award in our second
                    year for my involvement and passion in the STEM world, as a symbol of success for women in
                    technology. At the presentation, the judges highlighted how impressed they were with my
                    perseverance: The day before the competition our robot flooded during testing and I spent the night
                    taking apart our waterproofing setup and redoing it and all the wire connections.

                <p>
                    I was drawn to teaching swimming because of how much I enjoyed the Bronze Medallion and Cross
                    courses. Once I received my certification and a Swimming, Lifesaving and First Aid
                    instructor I worked in the evenings after school. I taught ages two to adults from the most
                    basic intro to swimming to Bronze and first aid courses. This was an amazing experience as
                    my first job because it gave me experience coaching/teaching, working with other people and
                    breaking down complex concepts to make teaching easier.

                <p>
                    Volunteering has always been one of my interests as it has allowed me a way to share my
                    knowledge and passions, particularly through STEM mentoring. I volunteered to help my former
                    school's all-girl First Lego League (FLL), VEX and Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE)
                    teams. This gave me the opportunity to mentor students from grade 6 to grade 12 as each team has a
                    different age focus and skill level. FLL is the first extracurricular opportunity for
                    younger students interested in robotics and, as a passionate member when I was in middle school, I
                    jumped at the opportunity to give back and help the younger students. When I started
                    mentoring the FLL team, it was replacing the robots with a newer model so I designed an organization
                    system, labeled all the kits, and put together lessons and a schedule to get the students
                    versed in the new lego and code. As the VEX mentor I assembled the field and helped the team select
                    a robot to build and compete with, while assisting the students to make changes and design
                    adjustments. I supported the team in their first competition and I am proud of how
                    exceedingly well they performed, considering it was the first year in the new format. I became a
                    MATE mentor after graduating high school, where I attended meetings when I was home for university
                    and helped members write code, came up with ideas and taught them about different hardware. I
                    also communicated with team members remotely when they had questions or issues and stayed in
                    communication with the teachers in order to be updated on their progress.
